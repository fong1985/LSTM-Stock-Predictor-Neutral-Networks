Which model has a lower loss?
LSTM Stock Predictor

Which model tracks the actual value better over time?
LSTM Stock Predictor

Which window size works best for the model?
I tried 10 - 50 window sizes.
LSTM Stock Predictor predicts better with higher
FNG Stock Predictor becomes less accurate with more window size
